### 1. System Overview

A cross-platform desktop application for Knowledge & Learning Management focused on content consumption, annotation, and concept relationship discovery. The architecture follows a modular, local-first approach prioritizing user privacy and offline functionality.

### 2. Architectural Approach

The project is organized as a monorepo using npm workspaces with the following packages:
- common-ui: Shared UI components
- core: Core business logic
- desktop-app: Electron desktop application
- platform-abstractions: Platform abstraction layer

#### 2.1 Core Architecture Pattern
- Layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Event-driven communication between components
- Local-first data persistence with optional cloud sync

#### 2.2 High-Level Components

##### 2.2.1 Frontend / UI Layer
- Cross-platform desktop interface
- Component-based UI architecture
- Responsive layout supporting multiple content formats

##### 2.2.2 Application Logic Layer
- Business logic for application flow
- State management and data flow control
- Event handling and component communication

##### 2.2.3 Content Processing Layer
- HTML parsing and cleanup for readable view
- Document format conversion
- Content extraction from various sources
- Preservation of semantic structure while removing clutter
- Typography and layout system for reading view

##### 2.2.4 AI Processing Layer
- Concept extraction and analysis
- Local embedding generation
- Hybrid AI processing (local and optional cloud)
- Learning path generation
- Phase 2 implementation planned

##### 2.2.5 Data Management Layer
- Local content storage
- Metadata management
- Relationship graph storage
- Vector database for semantic search
- Sync mechanism (optional)

#### 2.3 Integration Points
- Content import APIs
- Export interfaces
- Cloud sync endpoints (optional)
- Plugin system interfaces (future)

### 3. Technology Stack

#### 3.0 Package Structure
- Monorepo with npm workspaces
- TypeScript configuration with separate tsconfig files per package
- Webpack for bundling the renderer process
- Concurrently for running parallel build processes

#### 3.1 Frontend
- Electron framework for cross-platform desktop app
- React for UI components
- Lightweight markdown/text rendering system
- Custom annotation overlay system

#### 3.2 Application Logic
- TypeScript for type safety
- State management with Zustand
- Event bus for component communication
- Electron IPC for main-renderer process communication

#### 3.3 Content Processing
- HTML/DOM manipulation libraries (Cheerio, JSDOM)
- Mozilla's Readability for content extraction
- Custom text cleaning and formatting pipeline
- EPUB and PDF parsing libraries (in development)
- Image handling and optimization

#### 3.4 AI Processing
- Local LLM integration (planned)
- Optional cloud LLM APIs (planned)
- Vector embeddings for concept relationships (planned)
- Vector operations library for similarity search (planned)

#### 3.5 Storage
- Filesystem-based content storage (.md files)
- Electron Store for application settings
- Local database for metadata (in development)
- Vector storage for embeddings (planned)
- Encrypted storage utilities (planned)

### 4. Key Architectural Decisions

#### 4.1 Local-First Approach
- All data stored locally by default
- Full functionality without internet connection
- Optional cloud features as enhancement only

#### 4.2 Content Storage Format
- Human-readable markdown for content
- Separate annotation storage linked to content
- Portable file format for interoperability

#### 4.3 Content Processing Strategy
- Multi-stage pipeline for content cleaning
- Customizable reading view with user preferences
- Preservation of essential semantic elements
- Fallback mechanisms for parsing failures
- Progressive enhancement for different content types

#### 4.4 AI Implementation Strategy
- Layered AI approach (local for basic features, cloud for advanced)
- Progressive enhancement with AI capabilities
- User-controlled AI feature activation
- Implementation planned for Phase 2

#### 4.5 Data Graph Representation
- Concept nodes with relationship edges
- Weighted connections based on user interaction
- Bidirectional linking between content

### 5. System Interfaces

#### 5.1 External Interfaces
- Content import connectors
- Export formats
- Cloud sync API (optional)
- Local filesystem access

#### 5.2 Internal Interfaces
- UI to application logic events
- Application to AI processing calls
- Storage read/write operations
- Relationship graph queries

### 6. Performance Considerations

#### 6.1 Memory Management
- Lazy loading of content
- Virtual rendering for large documents
- Efficient graph traversal for relationships

#### 6.2 Processing Optimization
- Background AI processing
- Incremental relationship updates
- Cached search results and suggestions

### 7. Security and Privacy

#### 7.1 Data Protection
- Local encryption for sensitive data
- No data collection by default
- Transparency in any cloud features

#### 7.2 AI Processing Privacy
- Local AI processing prioritized
- Anonymized data for cloud processing
- Clear user consent for any data sharing
