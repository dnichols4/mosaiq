# Testing and Evaluating Classification Improvements

After making changes to the content classification system (either to the code or the taxonomy), it's important to evaluate whether these changes have led to actual improvements. Here's a conceptual strategy for testing and evaluation:

## 1. Prepare a Test Dataset

*   **Selection Criteria:** Create a representative dataset of 20-50 articles. This dataset should cover a variety of topics present in your taxonomy and include:
    *   Articles that were previously misclassified.
    *   Articles that were classified correctly but perhaps too broadly.
    *   Articles representing common and important concepts in your taxonomy.
    *   Some new articles not previously seen by the system.
*   **Manual "Ground Truth" Classification:** For each article in the test dataset, manually assign the "correct" or "ideal" set of concept classifications. This requires human judgment and a good understanding of the taxonomy.
    *   Define what "correct" means (e.g., top 1-3 most relevant concepts, specific level of granularity expected).
*   **Format:** Store this dataset in a way that's easy to process (e.g., a folder of text files, with a corresponding JSON or CSV file mapping article IDs to their ground truth concepts).

## 2. Establish Baselines

*   **Before Changes:** If possible, run the classification system *before* your planned improvements on the test dataset. Record the classifications produced. This will be your baseline.
*   **After Changes:** After implementing code or taxonomy changes, run the improved classification system on the same test dataset. Record these new classifications.

## 3. Evaluation Metrics (Qualitative and Quantitative)

*   **Qualitative Review:**
    *   Manually compare the new classifications against the ground truth and the baseline classifications for each article.
    *   Are the new classifications more accurate? More specific? Less noisy?
    *   Note down specific examples of improvements or regressions.
*   **Quantitative Metrics (Optional, for more rigor):**
    *   **Precision@k:** For each article, what proportion of the top K classifications suggested by the system are present in the ground truth set? (e.g., if system suggests 3 concepts, and 2 are in ground truth, Precision@3 is 2/3).
    *   **Recall@k:** For each article, what proportion of the ground truth concepts were found within the top K classifications suggested by the system?
    *   **F1-Score@k:** The harmonic mean of Precision@k and Recall@k.
    *   **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR):** If you primarily care about the single most relevant classification being highly ranked.
    *   **Overall Accuracy:** Percentage of articles where the top suggested concept (or top N concepts) perfectly match the ground truth.

## 4. Iterative Process

*   Evaluation is not a one-time step. Use the results to identify areas for further improvement.
*   For example, if certain types of articles or concepts are still being misclassified, this might point to specific weaknesses in the `TextBasedClassifier`'s scoring for those areas, issues with particular taxonomy definitions, or limitations in the embedding model for certain types of content.
*   Refine your system (code or taxonomy) and re-evaluate.

## 5. Tracking Key Parameters

*   When evaluating, pay attention to the configuration parameters in `ClassificationService.ts`:
    *   `confidenceThreshold` (for fused scores).
    *   The raw score threshold used for `TextBasedClassifier` (currently placeholder `1.0`).
    *   `textWeight` and `vectorWeight`.
*   These parameters may need tuning based on evaluation results to optimize performance for your specific content and taxonomy. For example, if raw scores from the text classifier are generally low, the `1.0` threshold might be too high. If they are very high, it might be too low.

By following a structured approach to testing and evaluation, you can gain confidence in the improvements made and systematically enhance the content classification capabilities of the application.
