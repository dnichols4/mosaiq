# Phased Implementation Plan: PKM Cross-Platform Refactoring

## Phase 1: Architectural Restructuring

### Objectives
- Restructure codebase to support shared logic across platforms
- Implement abstraction layers without changing functionality
- Set up platform detection infrastructure

### Key Tasks
1. Create monorepo structure with core packages:
   - `core`: shared business logic
   - `platform-abstractions`: interfaces for platform-specific code
   - `desktop-app`: existing Electron app
   - `common-ui`: shared React components

2. Define key interfaces:
   - `IStorageProvider`
   - `IPlatformCapabilities`
   - `IContentProcessor`

3. Create platform detection utilities to identify environment

4. Refactor build pipeline to support multiple targets

### Exit Criteria
- Electron app continues to function identically
- Shared interfaces defined for all major system components
- Monorepo structure established with proper module boundaries

## Phase 2: Storage Layer Abstraction

### Objectives
- Abstract all filesystem operations behind interfaces
- Create adapter pattern for storage operations
- Prepare for multiple storage backends

### Key Tasks
1. Create storage adapter interfaces:
   - `IContentStorage`: document storage and retrieval
   - `IMetadataStorage`: SQLite abstraction
   - `IVectorStorage`: embeddings storage

2. Implement Electron-specific adapters:
   - `FileSystemContentAdapter`
   - `SQLiteMetadataAdapter`
   - `LocalVectorAdapter`

3. Create storage factory with dependency injection

4. Refactor existing code to use adapters rather than direct FS calls

5. Implement data serialization/deserialization utilities

### Exit Criteria
- All file operations routed through adapters
- No direct filesystem calls in business logic
- Unit tests for storage operations through abstraction layer

## Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring

### Objectives
- Separate platform-specific UI code
- Create responsive component library
- Abstract native desktop features

### Key Tasks
1. Audit UI components for platform dependencies

2. Extract platform-agnostic components to shared library

3. Create platform-specific component wrappers:
   - `PlatformDialog`
   - `FilePickerAdapter`
   - `NotificationSystem`

4. Implement capability-based feature detection

5. Create fallback UI patterns for missing capabilities

### Exit Criteria
- Shared UI component library established
- Platform-specific code isolated to adapter components
- Component storybook with platform-specific variants

## Phase 4: Offline-First Sync Framework

### Objectives
- Implement CRDT-based data model
- Create sync infrastructure for multi-device usage
- Develop conflict resolution strategies

### Key Tasks
1. Implement CRDT data structures for conflict-free merging:
   - `DocumentCRDT`
   - `AnnotationCRDT`
   - `MetadataCRDT`

2. Create sync orchestration service

3. Implement queue management for offline operations

4. Develop lightweight API server for sync operations

5. Create authentication framework supporting offline access

6. Implement encryption for synchronized data

### Exit Criteria
- Data structures support conflict-free merging
- Sync operations work in offline-first mode
- Authentication flow works across platforms
- Demo sync between multiple desktop instances

## Phase 5: Web Platform Implementation

### Objectives
- Create browser-compatible storage adapters
- Implement web application entry point
- Enable progressive web app capabilities

### Key Tasks
1. Implement browser storage adapters:
   - `IndexedDBContentAdapter`
   - `IndexedDBMetadataAdapter`
   - `BrowserVectorAdapter`

2. Create web application entry point and routing

3. Implement service worker for offline capabilities

4. Create browser-specific optimizations:
   - Code splitting
   - Resource loading prioritization
   - Cache management

5. Implement progressive web app manifest

6. Create fallback strategies for browser limitations

### Exit Criteria
- Web application runs with core functionality
- Offline capabilities work in browser
- Consistent UX between desktop and web versions
- PWA installable on supported platforms

## Phase 6: AI Processing Adaptation

### Objectives
- Adapt AI processing layer for cross-platform use
- Implement capability-based AI feature activation
- Create server-side processing options for web

### Key Tasks
1. Create AI processing strategy factory:
   - `LocalProcessingStrategy`
   - `RemoteProcessingStrategy`
   - `HybridProcessingStrategy`

2. Implement browser-compatible vector operations

3. Create server-side AI processing endpoints

4. Implement progressive enhancement for AI features

5. Optimize for bandwidth and performance constraints

### Exit Criteria
- AI features work on both platforms with appropriate fallbacks
- Consistent experience with different capability levels
- Resource usage optimized for platform constraints

## Phase 7: Feature Parity and Polish

### Objectives
- Ensure consistent experience across platforms
- Address platform-specific edge cases
- Optimize performance for both environments

### Key Tasks
1. Conduct feature parity audit

2. Implement missing capabilities with appropriate alternatives

3. Create unified settings management

4. Perform cross-platform usability testing

5. Optimize performance and resource usage

6. Create unified documentation for both platforms

### Exit Criteria
- Feature parity achieved with platform-appropriate implementations
- Consistent user experience across platforms
- Performance optimization targets met
- User documentation covers both platforms

## Key Principles Throughout Implementation

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Each component should have tests before refactoring
2. **Gradual Integration**: Changes merged incrementally, never breaking main branch
3. **Feature Toggles**: Use feature flags to enable/disable functionality during transition
4. **Compatibility Layers**: Maintain backward compatibility for existing users
5. **Performance Metrics**: Establish baselines and monitor throughout refactoring
