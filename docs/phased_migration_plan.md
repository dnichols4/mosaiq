# Phased Implementation Plan: Cross-Platform Refactoring

## Phase 1: Architectural Restructuring (COMPLETED)

### Objectives

*   ✅ Restructure codebase to support shared logic across platforms
*   ✅ Implement abstraction layers without changing functionality
*   ✅ Set up platform detection infrastructure

### Key Tasks

Create monorepo structure with core packages:

*   ✅ `core`: shared business logic
*   ✅ `platform-abstractions`: interfaces for platform-specific code
*   ✅ `desktop-app`: existing Electron app
*   ✅ `common-ui`: shared React components

Define key interfaces:

*   ✅ `IStorageProvider`
*   ✅ `IPlatformCapabilities`
*   ✅ `IContentProcessor`

✅ Create platform detection utilities to identify environment

✅ Refactor build pipeline to support multiple targets

### Exit Criteria

*   ✅ Electron app continues to function identically

*   ✅ Monorepo structure established with proper module boundaries

## Phase 2: Storage Layer Abstraction (PARTIAL)

### Objectives

*   ✅ Abstract all filesystem operations behind interfaces
*   ✅ Create adapter pattern for storage operations
*   ✅ Prepare for multiple storage backends

### Key Tasks

Implement Electron-specific adapters:

*   ✅ `FileSystemContentAdapter`
*   ✅ `ElectronStorageAdapter` (implemented instead of SQLiteMetadataAdapter)
*   ❌ `LocalVectorAdapter` (planned for future)

✅ Create adapter factory with dependency injection

✅ Refactor existing code to use adapters rather than direct FS calls

❌ Implement data serialization/deserialization utilities (partial implementation)

### Exit Criteria

*   ✅ All file operations routed through adapters
*   ✅ No direct filesystem calls in business logic

## Phase 3: UI Component Refactoring (PARTIAL)

### Objectives

*   ✅ Separate platform-specific UI code
*   ✅ Create responsive component library

✅ Audit UI components for platform dependencies

✅ Extract platform-agnostic components to shared library

Create platform-specific component wrappers:

*   ❌ `PlatformDialog`
*   ❌ `FilePickerAdapter`
*   ❌ `NotificationSystem`

✅ Implement capability-based feature detection

❌ Create fallback UI patterns for missing capabilities

### Exit Criteria

*   ✅ Shared UI component library established
*   ✅ Platform-specific code isolated to adapter components
*   ❌ Component storybook with platform-specific variants

## Phase 4: Offline-First Sync Framework

### Objectives

*   Demo sync between multiple desktop instances

## Phase 5: Web Platform Implementation

### Objectives

*   Create browser-compatible storage adapters
*   Implement web application entry point
*   Enable progressive web app capabilities

### Key Tasks

Implement browser storage adapters:

*   `IndexedDBContentAdapter`
*   `IndexedDBMetadataAdapter`
*   `BrowserVectorAdapter`

Create web application entry point and routing

Implement service worker for offline capabilities

Create browser-specific optimizations:

*   Code splitting
*   Resource loading prioritization
*   Cache management

Implement progressive web app manifest

Create fallback strategies for browser limitations

### Exit Criteria

*   Web application runs with core functionality
*   Offline capabilities work in browser
*   Consistent UX between desktop and web versions
*   PWA installable on supported platforms

## Phase 6: AI Processing Adaptation

### Objectives

*   Adapt AI processing layer for cross-platform use
*   Implement capability-based AI feature activation
*   Create server-side processing options for web

### Key Tasks

Create AI processing strategy factory:

*   `LocalProcessingStrategy`
*   `RemoteProcessingStrategy`
*   `HybridProcessingStrategy`

Implement browser-compatible vector operations

Create server-side AI processing endpoints

Implement progressive enhancement for AI features

Optimize for bandwidth and performance constraints

### Exit Criteria

*   AI features work on both platforms with appropriate fallbacks
*   Consistent experience with different capability levels
*   Resource usage optimized for platform constraints

## Phase 7: Feature Parity and Polish

### Objectives

*   Ensure consistent experience across platforms
*   Address platform-specific edge cases
*   Optimize performance for both environments

### Key Tasks

Conduct feature parity audit

Implement missing capabilities with appropriate alternatives

Create unified settings management

Perform cross-platform usability testing

Optimize performance and resource usage

Create unified documentation for both platforms

### Exit Criteria

*   Feature parity achieved with platform-appropriate implementations
*   Consistent user experience across platforms
*   Performance optimization targets met
*   User documentation covers both platforms

## Key Principles Throughout Implementation

1.  **Test-Driven Development**: Each component should have tests before refactoring
2.  **Gradual Integration**: Changes merged incrementally, never breaking main branch
3.  **Feature Toggles**: Use feature flags to enable/disable functionality during transition
4.  **Compatibility Layers**: Maintain backward compatibility for existing users
5.  **Performance Metrics**: Establish baselines and monitor throughout refactoring

## Implementation Status and Recommendations (2025-04-10)

### Current Progress

* Phase 1 (Architectural Restructuring) has been fully completed
* Phase 2 (Storage Layer Abstraction) is partially completed with core interfaces and adapters implemented
* Phase 3 (UI Component Refactoring) is partially completed with shared UI components and isolation of platform-specific code
* Phases 4-7 have not yet begun implementation

### Recommendations

1. **Complete Phase 2 Storage Implementation**
   * Implement unit tests for the storage abstraction layer
   * Complete data serialization/deserialization utilities
   * Consider whether separate specialized storage interfaces are needed or if the unified `IStorageProvider` is sufficient

2. **Prioritize UI Component Platform Abstraction**
   * Implement the planned platform-specific component wrappers
   * Create component storybook for better development and testing
   * Complete the fallback UI patterns for capabilities that might be missing on different platforms

3. **Consider RDF/Knowledge Graph Implementation**
   * The existing RDF dependencies in the root package.json suggest planned knowledge graph functionality
   * This should be aligned with Phase 4's data synchronization strategy
   * Consider implementing basic RDF storage before moving to full CRDT-based sync

4. **Evaluate Phase Order**
   * Consider implementing aspects of Phase 6 (AI Processing) before Phase 5 (Web Platform)
   * As AI functionality is a core differentiator, having it ready for the desktop platform could provide valuable feedback
   * The current order still makes sense if web platform support is a higher priority than AI features

5. **Testing Infrastructure**
   * Implement comprehensive testing before proceeding with further phases
   * The absence of tests could lead to regression issues when implementing cross-platform capabilities

The phased implementation plan remains sound, but completing the partially implemented phases before moving forward is recommended. The architectural foundation is solid, but more investment in testing and completing the storage and UI abstractions would provide a stronger base for subsequent phases.
