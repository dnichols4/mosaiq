## Current Implementation

### Project Overview
Mosaiq is a Knowledge & Learning Management application with a local-first architecture focused on content consumption, annotation, and concept relationship discovery. The project has been restructured as a monorepo using npm workspaces.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Electron + React
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Content Processing**: Cheerio, Mozilla's Readability, JSDOM
- **Storage**: Electron-store + filesystem
- **Build Tools**: TypeScript, Webpack, Concurrently

### Architecture
The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:
- **UI Layer**: React components in common-ui package
- **Application Logic Layer**: State management with Zustand
- **Content Processing Layer**: HTML parsing and cleanup with Readability
- **Data Management Layer**: Local storage using Electron-store and filesystem
- **Platform Abstraction Layer**: Interfaces for platform-specific functionality

### Current Features
- URL saving with enhanced content extraction
- Simple list view of saved resources
- Reader mode content viewing with customization
- Local-first storage of content and metadata
- Dark/light mode support
- Typography controls (font size, line spacing, width)

### Build Setup
- TypeScript compilation for main process and core packages
- Webpack bundling for renderer process
- npm workspaces for package management
- Concurrently for parallel build processes
- Development setup with hot reloading
- Production build process

### Current Limitations
- No annotation capabilities yet
- No tagging or search functionality
- No content relationship discovery
- AI features planned for Phase 2

## Implemented Reader Mode Improvements

### Content Parsing Enhancements

We implemented significant improvements to content extraction and presentation:

1. **Mozilla Readability Integration**
   - Added Mozilla's Readability library to extract main content
   - Implemented JSDOM for DOM manipulation in Node.js environment
   - Added heuristics for better identification of article content

2. **Metadata Extraction**
   - Added extraction of author information
   - Added extraction of publication date
   - Implemented featured image detection
   - Normalized metadata across different page structures

3. **Content Processing Pipeline**
   - Implemented link absolutization to fix relative URLs
   - Added target="_blank" for external links
   - Created image processing to ensure proper display
   - Enhanced excerpt generation

### Reader Mode Display

1. **Typography Enhancements**
   - Implemented clean, readable typography system
   - Created proper heading hierarchy styles
   - Added responsive layout with optimal line length
   - Enhanced paragraph and block element spacing

2. **Reader UI Components**
   - Created ArticleViewer component for content display
   - Implemented ArticleHeader for metadata presentation
   - Built ReadingControls panel for customization
   - Added comprehensive dark/light mode support

3. **Reading Settings**
   - Implemented font size adjustment
   - Added line height controls
   - Created content width adjustment
   - Built theme switching (dark/light modes)
   - Added persistent settings storage

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Data Model Updates**
   - Enhanced UrlData interface with metadata fields
   - Added Reading Settings model for preferences
   - Created TypeScript type definitions

2. **IPC Communication**
   - Updated IPC handlers for reading settings
   - Implemented secure communication through preload bridge
   - Added proper error handling

3. **State Management**
   - Created settingsStore for reading preferences
   - Updated urlStore with enhanced metadata
   - Implemented context isolation compliance for Electron

### Security Considerations

1. **Electron Context Isolation**
   - Replaced direct fs access with IPC communications
   - Implemented proper preload bridge pattern
   - Added fallback mechanisms for graceful error handling

2. **Data Handling**
   - Enhanced content sanitization
   - Added secure storage for user preferences
   - Implemented proper error boundaries

## Implemented Article View and Content Organization

### Article Display Improvements
1. **Full-Width Reading Experience**
   - Updated ContentViewer component to utilize the full screen width
   - Modified ArticleViewer component to be responsive and centered
   - Improved CSS styles for better reading experience on various screen sizes
   - Enhanced the content-viewer-body to properly center article content
   - Changed "Close" button to more descriptive "Back to List" text
   - Fixed modal-like appearance by replacing fixed positioning with responsive layout
   - Made article content truly full-width and responsive to screen size
   - Increased default reading width from 680px to 800px for better readability
   - Added larger width adjustment increments in reading controls

### Content Organization Features
1. **Article Removal Capability**
   - Implemented deleteUrl function in urlStorage module to remove articles and their content files
   - Added IPC handler for URL deletion
