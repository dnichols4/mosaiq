    * Clarification: Sync mechanism should support offline-first operations with conflict resolution using CRDT data structures

#### 2.3 Integration Points

*   Content import APIs
*   Export interfaces
*   Cloud sync endpoints (optional)
*   Plugin system interfaces (future)

### 4\. Key Architectural Decisions

#### 4.1 Local-First Approach

*   ✅ All data stored locally by default (Implemented with filesystem storage)
*   ✅ Full functionality without internet connection (All core features work offline)
*   ❌ Optional cloud features as enhancement only (Cloud features not yet implemented)

#### 4.2 Content Storage Format

*   ✅ Human-readable markdown for content (Implemented storage format)
*   🔄 Separate annotation storage linked to content (Data structures defined, UI pending)
*   ✅ Portable file format for interoperability (Implemented with standardized formats)
    * Clarification: Annotations should be stored in a format that maintains references to the original content even if content is moved or renamed

#### 4.3 Content Processing Strategy

*   ✅ Multi-stage pipeline for content cleaning (Implemented in ElectronContentProcessor)
*   ✅ Customizable reading view with user preferences (Implemented with SettingsSlider)
*   ✅ Preservation of essential semantic elements (Implemented with Readability)
*   ✅ Fallback mechanisms for parsing failures (Error handling implemented)
*   🔄 Progressive enhancement for different content types (Partial: HTML complete, other formats pending)
    * Clarification: System should gracefully degrade functionality when encountering unsupported content types rather than failing completely

#### 4.4 AI Implementation Strategy

*   ✅ Layered AI approach (Implemented with local MiniLM model)
*   ✅ Progressive enhancement with AI capabilities (Classification with confidence thresholds)
*   🔄 User-controlled AI feature activation (Partial: Backend configuration implemented, UI controls pending)
    * Clarification: Users should be able to enable/disable specific AI features individually and adjust confidence thresholds for classification suggestions

#### 4.5 Data Graph Representation

*   ✅ Concept nodes with relationship edges (Implemented via TaxonomyService)
*   🔄 Weighted connections based on user interaction (Data structures defined, tracking pending)
*   🔄 Bidirectional linking between content (Partial: Backend support implemented, UI pending)
    * Clarification: System should track user navigation patterns to strengthen relationships between frequently co-accessed content

### 5\. System Interfaces

#### 5.1 External Interfaces

*   ✅ Content import connectors (Web content import implemented)
*   🔄 Export formats (Partial: Basic export implemented, advanced formats pending)
*   ❌ Cloud sync API (Not implemented, planned for Phase 4)
*   ✅ Local filesystem access (Complete implementation with abstraction layer)
    * Clarification: Export should support multiple formats including markdown, HTML, and PDF with embedded annotations as optional inclusions

#### 5.2 Internal Interfaces

*   ✅ UI to application logic events (Implemented with React Context and IPC)
*   ✅ Application to AI processing calls (Implemented via ClassificationService)
*   ✅ Storage read/write operations (Implemented via adapter interfaces)
*   🔄 Relationship graph queries (Partial: Basic queries implemented, advanced pending)

*   🔄 Virtual rendering for large documents (Partial: Basic implementation, optimization pending)
*   🔄 Efficient graph traversal for relationships (Partial: Basic traversal implemented, advanced optimization pending)
    * Clarification: Large documents (>1MB) should be paginated in memory with only visible content fully rendered to minimize memory consumption

#### 6.2 Processing Optimization

*   ✅ Background AI processing (Implemented with non-blocking classification)
*   🔄 Incremental relationship updates (Partial: Data structures defined, implementation pending)
*   🔄 Cached search results and suggestions (Partial: Basic caching implemented, advanced pending)
    * Clarification: Search caching should use LRU (Least Recently Used) strategy with configurable cache size limits and TTL (Time To Live) settings

### 7\. Security and Privacy

#### 7.1 Data Protection

*   ❌ Local encryption for sensitive data (Not yet implemented, planned for future)
*   ✅ No data collection by default (Implemented privacy-first approach)
*   ❌ Transparency in any cloud features (Cloud features not yet implemented)
    * Clarification: Encryption should use industry-standard AES-256 with secure key management allowing user-defined passphrase protection

#### 7.2 AI Processing Privacy

*   ✅ Local AI processing prioritized (Implemented with MiniLM model)
*   ❌ Anonymized data for cloud processing (Cloud processing not yet implemented)
*   ❌ Clear user consent for any data sharing (Cloud features not yet implemented)
