*   ‚ùå Plugin system interfaces (Future, not implemented)

### 4\. Key Architectural Decisions

#### 4.1 Local-First Approach

*   ‚úÖ All data stored locally by default (Implemented with filesystem storage for content via `FileSystemContentAdapter` and Electron Store for metadata via `ElectronStorageAdapter`)
*   ‚úÖ Full functionality without internet connection (All core features, including AI processing with local models, work offline)
*   ‚ùå Optional cloud features as enhancement only (Cloud features not yet implemented)

#### 4.2 Content Storage Format

*   ‚úÖ Human-readable markdown for content (Implemented as the primary storage format for processed content)
*   üîÑ Separate annotation storage linked to content (Data structures for annotations planned/defined, UI and robust linking mechanism pending)
*   ‚úÖ Portable file format for interoperability (Markdown files are portable; vector data also stored locally in specific formats like `.vec` and `metadata.json`)
    * Clarification: Annotations should be stored in a format (e.g., JSON or a separate linked file) that maintains robust references to the original content, even if the content is moved or renamed.

#### 4.3 Content Processing Strategy

*   ‚úÖ Multi-stage pipeline for content cleaning (Implemented in `ElectronContentProcessor`, including Readability and custom cleanup logic)
*   ‚úÖ Customizable reading view with user preferences (Implemented with `SettingsSlider` for font size, line height, content width)
*   ‚úÖ Preservation of essential semantic elements (Handled by Readability and post-processing logic in `ElectronContentProcessor`)
*   ‚úÖ Fallback mechanisms for parsing failures (Basic error handling implemented in content processing pipeline)
*   üîÑ Progressive enhancement for different content types (Partial: HTML content processing is robust. Graceful handling and feature availability for other types like PDF/EPUB needs further development)
    * Clarification: System should gracefully degrade functionality when encountering unsupported content types (e.g., extract text only from PDF if full layout parsing fails) rather than failing completely.

#### 4.4 AI Implementation Strategy

*   ‚úÖ Layered AI approach (Implemented with local MiniLM model for embeddings and text-based classification)
*   ‚úÖ Progressive enhancement with AI capabilities (Classification with confidence thresholds, allowing users to see suggestions based on confidence)
*   üîÑ User-controlled AI feature activation (Partial: Backend configuration for auto-classification via `ContentService.setAutoClassification()` and classification parameters in `ClassificationService` options exist. UI controls for these settings are pending)
    * Clarification: Users should be able to enable/disable specific AI features (like auto-classification on import/save) and adjust parameters like confidence thresholds for classification suggestions through the UI.

#### 4.5 Data Graph Representation

*   ‚úÖ Concept nodes with relationship edges (Implemented via `TaxonomyService` for SKOS concepts and their hierarchical relationships)
*   üîÑ Weighted connections based on user interaction (Data structures for explicit user-defined relationships planned; automatic weighting based on interaction pending)
*   üîÑ Bidirectional linking between content (Partial: Backend support for linking content items via concepts exists; UI for creating and visualizing these links pending)
    * Clarification: System should allow users to manually link content items and also potentially track user navigation patterns to suggest or strengthen relationships between frequently co-accessed content.

### 5\. System Interfaces

#### 5.1 External Interfaces

*   ‚úÖ Content import connectors (Web content import from URL implemented)
*   üîÑ Export formats (Partial: Basic export to markdown implemented. Advanced formats like PDF, or HTML with embedded annotations, are pending)
*   ‚ùå Cloud sync API (Not implemented, planned for Phase 4)
*   ‚úÖ Local filesystem access (Complete implementation with abstraction layer via `IStorageProvider` and specific adapters like `FileSystemContentAdapter`)
    * Clarification: Export should eventually support multiple formats including markdown, HTML, and PDF, with options to include/exclude annotations.

#### 5.2 Internal Interfaces

*   ‚úÖ UI to application logic events (Implemented with React Context for platform services and Electron IPC for core service communication)
*   ‚úÖ Application to AI processing calls (Implemented via `ClassificationService` and `EmbeddingService` interfaces)
*   ‚úÖ Storage read/write operations (Implemented via `IStorageProvider` and `IVectorStorage` adapter interfaces)
*   üîÑ Relationship graph queries (Partial: Basic queries for concepts and their direct relationships via `TaxonomyService` implemented. Advanced graph traversal queries for finding related content or learning paths pending)
    * Clarification: Graph queries should eventually support complex relationship traversal with filtering by relationship type, strength, and potentially temporal patterns to discover indirect connections.

### 6\. Performance Considerations

#### 6.1 Memory Management

*   ‚úÖ Lazy loading of content (Implemented for loading content items on demand)
*   üîÑ Virtual rendering for large documents (Partial: Basic display of long content implemented; optimization for very large documents with techniques like virtual scrolling pending)
*   üîÑ Efficient graph traversal for relationships (Partial: Basic traversal for taxonomy via `TaxonomyService` implemented; optimization for large, complex graphs of interconnected content and concepts pending)
    * Clarification: Large documents (>1MB or many pages) should be paginated or virtually scrolled in memory, with only visible content fully rendered to minimize memory consumption and maintain UI responsiveness.

#### 6.2 Processing Optimization

*   ‚úÖ Background AI processing (Implemented with non-blocking classification and embedding generation in services like `ContentService` and `ClassificationService`)
*   üîÑ Incremental relationship updates (Partial: Data structures for concepts exist; dynamic updates to relationships based on new content or user interactions are largely manual or batch-processed, not fully incremental yet)
*   üîÑ Cached search results and suggestions (Partial: Embedding caching via `cacheEmbeddings` option is implemented in `ClassificationService`. Broader caching for general search queries or concept suggestions is not yet implemented)
    * Clarification: Search caching should use an appropriate strategy (e.g., LRU) with configurable cache size limits and TTL (Time To Live) settings for relevance.

### 7\. Security and Privacy

#### 7.1 Data Protection

*   ‚ùå Local encryption for sensitive data (Not yet implemented, planned for future)
*   ‚úÖ No data collection by default (Implemented privacy-first approach; all data processing is local)
*   ‚ùå Transparency in any cloud features (Cloud features not yet implemented)
    * Clarification: If implemented, encryption should use industry-standard AES-256 with secure key management, potentially allowing user-defined passphrase protection for the local database/storage.

#### 7.2 AI Processing Privacy

*   ‚úÖ Local AI processing prioritized (Implemented with MiniLM model running locally; no data sent to external services for core AI features)
*   ‚ùå Anonymized data for cloud processing (Cloud processing not yet implemented)
*   ‚ùå Clear user consent for any data sharing (Cloud features not yet implemented)
    * Clarification: When/if cloud-based AI features are introduced, they must be opt-in. If data is sent, it should be anonymized where possible, and users must be clearly informed about what data is shared and for what purpose.

### 8\. Extensibility Framework

#### 8.1 Component Extensibility

*   ‚úÖ Interface-based component system (Core services and adapters use interfaces defined in `platform-abstractions`. UI components are React-based.)
*   ‚ùå Plugin architecture (Not yet implemented, planned for a future phase to allow third-party extensions)
*   üîÑ Custom view system (Partial: Reading view customization is implemented. Support for fully custom content views or UI themes is foundational but not extensively developed.)
    * Clarification: A future plugin architecture should ideally support signed packages with a capability-based permissions model and potentially a sandboxed execution environment for security.

#### 8.2 AI Extensibility

*   ‚úÖ Modular AI model integration (Implemented with `EmbeddingServiceFactory` allowing different embedding models, currently focused on MiniLM)
*   ‚úÖ Customizable AI processing parameters (Implemented with configurable thresholds and weights in `ClassificationService`)
*   üîÑ Multiple model support (Partial: The architecture via `EmbeddingServiceFactory` supports switching models. UI for model selection and management, and support for different *types* of models beyond embeddings, is pending)
    * Clarification: The system should eventually allow users to select from a range of local or even remote (opt-in) AI models based on task requirements, resource availability, and privacy preferences, with transparent performance and capability metrics.
