While the planned approach for automatic classification is robust and well-designed[cite: 110, 111, 218], here are a few potential areas for enhancement or further consideration, building upon the existing plans outlined in the documents:

1.  **Refine Taxonomy Integration in Scoring**:
    * The plan mentions considering taxonomy relationships during final filtering[cite: 102]. You could potentially formalize this earlier. For example, if a specific concept (e.g., "Electron IPC") scores highly, consider slightly boosting the scores of its direct parent concepts (e.g., "Electron Development") or sibling concepts during the scoring fusion step, not just during filtering. This is noted as a future enhancement [cite: 109] but might add value sooner.

2.  **Enhance User Feedback Mechanisms**:
    * Beyond allowing users to accept/reject classifications[cite: 98, 124, 163], consider capturing more granular feedback. For example, *why* was a suggestion rejected? (e.g., "Incorrect," "Too Broad," "Too Specific"). This richer feedback could accelerate the planned learning/adaptation phase[cite: 104, 146, 184, 216].
    * Allow users to mark a specific concept as definitively *not applicable* to a document, preventing its re-suggestion unless the document or model changes significantly.

3.  **Dynamic Weighting for Hybrid Scores**:
    * The initial plan uses a fixed weighting (e.g., 60/40) for combining text and vector scores[cite: 102]. Explore making this adaptable. Perhaps shorter documents rely more on vector similarity, while longer ones benefit more from term frequency analysis. This could be a refinement after the initial implementation.

4.  **Taxonomy Health and Maintenance**:
    * While the `TaxonomyService` handles loading and access[cite: 96, 147, 156], explicitly plan for tools or processes to periodically review the *taxonomy itself* for quality (e.g., identifying potentially ambiguous or overlapping concepts). The quality of the taxonomy is crucial for classification accuracy[cite: 119].

5.  **Handling Classification Ambiguity**:
    * If the system identifies multiple concepts with similar, moderate-to-high confidence scores[cite: 118], the UI could explicitly flag this ambiguity to the user[cite: 125], perhaps suggesting the top 2-3 candidates for review rather than just showing tags below a certain threshold.

6.  **Incremental Embedding Updates**:
    * For very long documents, investigate if embeddings can be generated or updated incrementally if only a small portion of the text changes, rather than reprocessing the entire document. This relates to performance optimizations[cite: 106, 174].

These suggestions aim to build upon the strong foundation already laid out in the project's documentation, potentially enhancing accuracy, user experience, and long-term maintainability.
