To confirm that the classification works for added content items, you can view the metadata in a few different ways:

1. **Through the Application UI (if available)**:
   - If there's a content details view, any assigned concepts should be visible there
   - Check if there's a metadata panel or tab in the content viewer

2. **Using the Electron Developer Tools**:
   - When viewing a content item, open the Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Go to the Application tab
   - Look under the Storage section for:
     - IndexedDB
     - LocalStorage
     - or Electron Store files

3. **Directly examining the metadata storage file**:
   - The application uses Electron Store for metadata, which is saved as a JSON file
   - Navigate to the app's user data directory:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\mosaiq\metadata.json`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mosaiq/metadata.json`
     - Linux: `~/.config/mosaiq/metadata.json`
   - Open this file in a text editor to see the stored metadata including classifications

4. **Using console logging**:
   - You could temporarily add some console.log statements to the ContentService to print classifications when content is loaded
   - Example: In `getItemWithContent` method of ContentService, add:
     ```typescript
     console.log('Content classifications:', item.concepts);
     ```

5. **Through IPC**:
   - You can use the IPC channel directly to get a content item's data including classifications
   - In the Developer Tools Console tab, try:
     ```javascript
     window.electronAPI.getItemWithContent('your-content-id').then(item => {
       console.log('Content item with classifications:', item);
     });
     ```

If none of these options work well for you, I could help implement a simple diagnostic tool that would display classification data for content items in a more accessible way. This could be done as a small addition to the UI or as a separate developer tool.


## Improving Content Classification via Taxonomy Enhancement

The accuracy of automatic content classification heavily depends on the quality, structure, and granularity of the `custom_knowledge_taxonomy.json` file. If you are finding that classifications are often incorrect, too broad, or missing, consider the following improvements to your taxonomy:

### 1. Enhance Concept Definitions (`skos:definition`)

The text-based classifier component relies significantly on the `definition` field of each concept to identify relevant keywords and understand the concept's meaning.

*   **Be Specific and Descriptive:** Definitions should clearly and concisely describe the concept. Avoid overly generic or vague definitions.
    *   *Example (less effective):* `"Physics": "The study of things."`
    *   *Example (more effective):* `"Physics": "The study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces of nature, including topics like mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism."`
*   **Include Distinguishing Keywords:** Ensure the definition contains keywords that help differentiate the concept from its parent, siblings, or related concepts. Think about what terms an article about this specific concept would likely use.
*   **Use `skos:altLabel` for Synonyms:** While definitions are key, also make good use of `skos:altLabel` for common synonyms or alternative phrasings of the concept's name. This helps the classifier match different ways a concept might be mentioned.

### 2. Review and Adjust Taxonomy Granularity

The current taxonomy provides a broad overview of many subjects. However, for more precise classification, you might need to add more specific (narrower) concepts in certain areas.

*   **Identify Areas for Deeper Hierarchy:** If you frequently save articles on a very specific sub-topic (e.g., "Natural Language Processing") but they are only getting classified under a broader term (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence"), consider adding "Natural Language Processing" as a narrower concept under "Artificial Intelligence."
*   **Balance Breadth and Depth:** Aim for a balance. An overly flat taxonomy might lead to broad classifications, while an excessively deep and granular taxonomy can become difficult to manage and might require very nuanced content to classify correctly.

### 3. Utilize `skos:related` Links Effectively

The classification system now considers `skos:related` links. If a document strongly matches concept A, and concept A is marked as `skos:related` to concept B, concept B might receive a score boost.

*   **Add Meaningful `skos:related` Links:** Populate `skos:related` fields for concepts that have a strong thematic connection but are not hierarchically related (i.e., not parent/child).
    *   *Example:* "Economics" could be `skos:related` to "Public Policy" or "Statistics."
*   **Ensure Symmetry if Applicable:** While the system doesn't require symmetry, SKOS best practices often suggest that if A is related to B, B should ideally also be listed as related to A, if the relationship is truly bidirectional.

### 4. Iterative Refinement

Improving the taxonomy is an ongoing process:
*   **Test Changes:** After making modifications to the taxonomy, observe how classification behavior changes for new and existing articles.
*   **Review Misclassifications:** When you encounter misclassified articles, examine the taxonomy to see if improved definitions, added granularity, or new related links could address the issue.

By investing in a well-structured and detailed taxonomy, you can significantly improve the accuracy and usefulness of the automatic content classification feature.
