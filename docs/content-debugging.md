To confirm that the classification works for added content items, you can view the metadata in a few different ways:

1. **Through the Application UI (if available)**:
   - If there's a content details view, any assigned concepts should be visible there
   - Check if there's a metadata panel or tab in the content viewer

2. **Using the Electron Developer Tools**:
   - When viewing a content item, open the Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I)
   - Go to the Application tab
   - Look under the Storage section for:
     - IndexedDB
     - LocalStorage
     - or Electron Store files

3. **Directly examining the metadata storage file**:
   - The application uses Electron Store for metadata, which is saved as a JSON file
   - Navigate to the app's user data directory:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\mosaiq\metadata.json`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/mosaiq/metadata.json`
     - Linux: `~/.config/mosaiq/metadata.json`
   - Open this file in a text editor to see the stored metadata including classifications

4. **Using console logging**:
   - You could temporarily add some console.log statements to the ContentService to print classifications when content is loaded
   - Example: In `getItemWithContent` method of ContentService, add:
     ```typescript
     console.log('Content classifications:', item.concepts);
     ```

5. **Through IPC**:
   - You can use the IPC channel directly to get a content item's data including classifications
   - In the Developer Tools Console tab, try:
     ```javascript
     window.electronAPI.getItemWithContent('your-content-id').then(item => {
       console.log('Content item with classifications:', item);
     });
     ```

If none of these options work well for you, I could help implement a simple diagnostic tool that would display classification data for content items in a more accessible way. This could be done as a small addition to the UI or as a separate developer tool.
